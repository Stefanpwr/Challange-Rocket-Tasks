Challange Rocket Tasks : 
1#Vitality of numbers :
How many times u have to multiply digits from a number to get 
one digit number? Example 1: 123 = 1*2*3 = 6/ So u have to do it 1 time.
Example 2 : 555 = 5*5*5 = 125, 1*2*5 = 10. 1*0 = 0/ So result is 3.
2#Digit solver : 
U have a String which have only digits in it, you have to return a String
containing digits multiplied by value of number they represent 
Example : 135 = 133355555
3#IncrementArray:
Converts array to a int, then increments it and finally converts it to array again
there is no ( no digit input in array) protection
4#CamelCase:
converts given String to camle-case string and removing all numbers
Example : myName1 -> my-name / Toma2szHaj22to - tomasz-hajto
